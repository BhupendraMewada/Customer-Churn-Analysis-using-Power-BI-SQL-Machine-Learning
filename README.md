# Customer Churn Analysis using Power BI, SQL, and Machine Learning

This project aims to analyze and predict customer churn by leveraging SQL for data processing, Power BI for visualization, and machine learning techniques for predictive modeling. The goal is to identify factors contributing to customer attrition and develop strategies to enhance retention.

## Project Overview

Customer churn, or the rate at which customers discontinue their service, is a critical metric for businesses. By understanding the factors that lead to churn, companies can implement targeted strategies to retain customers and reduce revenue loss.

## Objectives

- **Data Analysis:** Utilize SQL to process and analyze customer data to uncover patterns and correlations related to churn.
- **Visualization:** Employ Power BI to create interactive dashboards that highlight key insights and trends.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Develop machine learning models to predict which customers are at risk of churning.

## Data Sources

The project utilizes a dataset containing customer information, including demographics, account details, and service usage metrics. [Include details about the dataset's origin, structure, and any preprocessing steps if applicable.]

## Methodology

1. **Data Processing with SQL:**
   - Imported the dataset into a relational database.
   - Executed SQL queries to clean, transform, and aggregate data.
   - Extracted meaningful features relevant to customer churn analysis.

2. **Data Visualization with Power BI:**
   - Connected Power BI to the processed data.
   - Created interactive dashboards to visualize customer demographics, service usage, and churn distribution.
   - Implemented filters and slicers to allow dynamic data exploration.

3. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Utilized Python to develop machine learning models aimed at predicting customer churn.
   - Employed algorithms such as Random Forest and Logistic Regression.
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Key Findings

- Identified significant factors contributing to customer churn, such as contract type, tenure, and service usage patterns.
- Developed a predictive model with [insert accuracy]% accuracy in identifying at-risk customers.
- Provided actionable insights to inform customer retention strategies.

## Tools and Technologies

- **SQL:** Data cleaning, transformation, and feature extraction.
- **Power BI:** Data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Python:** Machine learning model development and evaluation.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For developing and documenting the predictive modeling process.
